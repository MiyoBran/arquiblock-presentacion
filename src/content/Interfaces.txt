---------- Explicacion de la interfaz dada por la herramienta:
Certainly, here are more detailed descriptions for each screen of the construction management system app, elaborating on their intended functionality and design considerations:

Production Schedule: This screen displays a calendar interface showcasing active construction projects. Each project is marked with key milestones and projected progress dates, allowing for a visual representation of project timelines. The design prioritizes a clean and color-coded layout to easily distinguish between different projects and their stages, aiding in quick assessment of workload distribution and potential overlaps.

Delivery Schedule: This interface provides a comprehensive view of scheduled material deliveries, organized by project and delivery date. It details the items to be delivered, assigned vehicles (whether company-owned or third-party), and includes sections for confirmation upon successful delivery. The design emphasizes clear categorization and filtering options, enabling users to efficiently track and manage logistics, ensuring timely material availability on-site.

Project Dashboard: Offering a real-time overview, this dashboard consolidates critical project metrics. It features progress trackers for various construction phases, real-time material consumption against budget, and associated costs. Key dates such as client payments, scheduled deliveries, and inspections are prominently displayed. The design employs visual indicators and progress bars to provide an intuitive grasp of project status, supporting informed decision-making.

Budget Tracking: This screen facilitates a detailed comparison between the initial project budget and actual expenditures. It breaks down costs into categories like materials, labor, and indirect expenses, highlighting variances to monitor financial health. The interface includes visual reports and summaries to quickly identify areas of overspending or potential savings, enhancing financial oversight and control.

Progress Updates: Designed for on-site staff, this interface allows for direct reporting of project advancements. It supports daily or weekly updates on phase completions, actual material usage, and recorded work hours. The inclusion of fields for photos, comments, and issue reporting ensures comprehensive feedback from the field, fostering real-time communication and problem-solving.
